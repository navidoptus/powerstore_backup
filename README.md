# PowerStore NAS Cloning and Automated Backup Script

This repository contains a PowerShell script that automates the daily cloning and NDMP backup preparation for a PowerStore NAS server at a Disaster Recovery (DR) site. It ensures consistent backups by creating daily NAS clones, assigning static IPs, and setting up NDMP configurations for automated backups.

## Overview
This script provides a fully automated solution for cloning and preparing NAS servers at the DR site for daily backups, ensuring an isolated environment for data consistency and minimizing manual intervention.

### Key Features
- **Automated Daily NAS Cloning**: Creates a new clone every day.
- **IP Assignment**: Assigns a static IP to each clone, maintaining accessibility.
- **NDMP Backup Configuration**: Configures NDMP settings on each clone for backup access.
- **Scheduling Compatibility**: Set up for daily automation with Task Scheduler or cron.

## Prerequisites

1. **PowerStore API Access**:
   - Access to PowerStoreâ€™s REST API endpoint with valid credentials.

2. **Server for Script Execution**:
   - A Windows server with PowerShell installed or a Linux server (requires script adaptation).
   - Network connectivity to PowerStore's management IP.

3. **NDMP-Compatible Backup Solution**:
   - Ensure your backup system is NDMP-compatible and can connect to PowerStore.

4. **Static IP Address**:
   - One extra static IP on the DR network to assign to each daily clone.

---

## Script Execution Flow

1. **Daily NAS Cloning**:
   - The script generates a read-write clone of the DR NAS server each day.
   
2. **Assigning Static IP**:
   - Assigns a single, pre-configured IP address to the clone, maintaining network isolation from production.

3. **NDMP Configuration for Backup**:
   - Configures NDMP on the clone to prepare it for incremental or full backups.

4. **Automated Execution**:
   - The script is designed to run automatically using Task Scheduler or cron for consistent daily backups.

---

## Setting Up the Script

1. **Open PowerShell** on the designated server.
2. **Replace Placeholder Values**: Update the script with your specific PowerStore IP, credentials, NAS IDs, and other required details.
3. **Manual Test**: Run the script manually to ensure proper functionality.
4. **Schedule the Script**: Once verified, set up daily scheduling to automate execution.

---

## Script Scheduling

- **Windows**: Use Task Scheduler to create a new daily task, selecting the PowerShell script as the program.
- **Linux**: Adapt the script for Bash and schedule with `cron` for daily execution.

---

## Script Code

Below is the full PowerShell script that automates NAS cloning and NDMP backup configuration. Replace all placeholder values as instructed in the script comments.

## Final Notes

- **Testing**: Before scheduling, run the script manually to verify functionality.
- **Error Handling**: Review and adjust error-handling as needed.
- **Automation** : Once verified, automate the script with Task Scheduler or cron for consistent execution.
