## Overview

This solution provides two approaches for PowerStore NAS backups:
1. **NAS Server Cloning**: Creates a writable, point-in-time copy of the NAS server on the DR site for backup.
2. **File System Snapshotting**: Creates read-only snapshots of individual file systems on the NAS server, which is more space-efficient.

Each backup method supports NDMP configuration and includes an automated 35-day retention policy to manage storage efficiently.

## Backup Options

### Option 1: NAS Server Cloning
With this approach, the script creates a **writable clone** of the DR NAS server for backup.

- **Ideal For**: Situations requiring full, independent copies of NAS servers.
- **Script**: [Clone Backup Script](scripts/Clone_Backup_Script.ps1)

### Option 2: File System Snapshotting
This method creates **read-only snapshots** of individual file systems, suitable for lightweight, point-in-time backups.

- **Ideal For**: Scenarios where only specific file systems need to be backed up with minimal storage use.
- **Script**: [Snapshot Backup Script](scripts/Snapshot_Backup_Script.ps1)
